A morgue is a morgue is a morgue.  They can paint the walls with aggressively
cheerful primary colors and splashy bold graphics, but it's still a holding
place for the dead until they can be parted out to organ banks.  Not that I
would have cared normally but my viewpoint was skewed.  The relentless
pleasance of the room I sat in seemed only grotesque.

The human instinct to censor thrives, as it always will, living in
irrepressible conflict with the human instinct to speak.  Outrage,
self-righteousness, and paranoia feed the maw of censorship.
Squelching speech, however, never reduces society's net paranoia
quotient; it simply redirects it, drives it underground, where it
festers into more dangerous hysterias.  In the words of Justice
Brandeis, "Men feared witches and burned women."

	A multisibling sensibility derived from having grown up in
large families.  A rarity in those born after approximately 1965,
symptoms of Bradyism include a facility for mind games, emotional

well-defined personal space.

continually exhausted from their voraciously acquisitive pursuit of
furniture and knickknacks.

"Good afternoon, madam.  How may I help you?"

"Good afternoon.  I'd like a FrintArms HandCannon, please."

"A--?  Oh, now, that's an awfully big gun for such a lovely lady.  I
mean, not everybody thinks ladies should carry guns at all, though I
say they have a right to.  But I think... I might... Let's have a look
down here.  I might have just the thing for you.  Yes, here we are!
Look at that, isn't it neat?  Now that is a FrintArms product as well,
but it's what's called a laser -- a light-pistol some people call
them.  Very small, as you see; fits easily into a pocket or bag; won't
spoil the line of a jacket; and you won't feel you're lugging half a
tonne of iron around with you.  We do a range of matching accessories,
including -- if I may say so -- a rather saucy garter holster.  Wish I
got to do the fitting for that!  Ha -- just my little joke.  And
there's *even*... here we are -- this special presentation pack: gun,
charged battery, charging unit, beautiful glider-hide shoulder holster
with adjustable fitting and contrast stitching, and a discount on your
next battery.  Full instructions, of course, and a voucher for free
lessons at your local gun club or range.  Or there's the *special*
presentation pack; it has all the other one's got but with *two*
charged batteries and a night-sight, too.  Here, feel that -- don't
worry, it's a dummy battery -- isn't it neat?  Feel how light it is?
Smooth, see?  No bits to stick out and catch on your clothes, *and*
beautifully balanced.  And of course the beauty of a laser is, there's
no recoil.  Because it's shooting light, you see?  Beautiful gun,
beautiful gun; my wife has one.  Really.  That's not a line, she
really has.  Now, I can do you that one -- with a battery and a free
charge -- for ninety-five; or the presentation pack on a special
offer for one-nineteen; or this, the special presentation pack, for
one-forty-nine."

"I'll take the special."

"Sound choice, madam, *sound* choice.  Now, do--?"

"And a HandCannon, with the eighty-mill silencer, five GP clips, three
six-five AP/wire-fl'echettes clips, two bipropellant HE clips, and a
Special Projectile Pack if you have one -- the one with the embedding
rounds, not the signalers.  I assume the night-sight on this toy is
compatible?"

"Aah... yes,  And how does madam wish to pay?"

She slapped her credit card on the counter.  "Eventually."

Guilt.  The Big G, the Catholic faith's greatest gift to humankind and

little too harshly; I've met a lot of Jews, and they seem to have just
as hard a time of it as we do, and they've been around longer, so
maybe it wasn't the Church's invention ... but I maintain it developed
the concept more fully than anybody else; it was the Japan of guilt,
taking somebody else's product and mass-producing it, refining it,
fine-tuning it, optimising its performance and giving it a life-time
guarantee.

Take some time and put the bible on your summer reading list.  Try to
stick with it cover to cover.  Not because it teaches history -- we've
shown you it doesn't.  Read it because you'll see for yourself what
the bible is all about -- it sure isn't great literature.  If it were
published as fiction, no reviewer would give it a passing grade.
There are some vivid scenes and some quotable phrases, but there's no
plot, no structure, there's a tremendous amount of filler, and the
characters are painfully one dimensional.

Whatever you do, don't read the bible for a moral code.  It advocates
prejudice, cruelty, superstition, and murder.  Read it because we need
more atheists, and nothing will get you there faster than reading the
damn bible.

impoverishing ration system it really was, become a bunch of
interfering, do-gooding busybodies, resist the siren call of
self-promotion that was Subliming and free your conscious machines to
do what they did best -- essentially, running everything -- and there

Anaplian realised they had got rather rapidly to the point that all
such conversations regarding the strategic intentions of the Culture
tended to arrive at sooner or later, where it became clear that the
issue boiled down to the question What Are The Minds Really Up To?
This was always a good question, and it was usually only churls and
determinedly diehard cynics who even bothered to point out that it
rarely, if ever, arrived paired up with an equally good answer.

The normal, almost ingrained response of people at this point was to
metaphorically throw their hands in the air and exclaim that if *that*
was what it really all boiled down to then there was no point in even
attempting to pursue the issue further because as soon as the
motivations, analyses and stratagems of Minds become the defining
factor in a matter, all bets were most profoundly off, for the simple
reason that any and all efforts to second-guess such infinitely subtle
and hideously devious devices were self-evidentally futile.

Anaplian was not so sure about this.  It was her suspicion that it
suited the purposes of the Minds rather too neatly that people
believed this so unquestioningly.  Such a reaction represented not so
much the honest appraisal of further enquiry as being pointless as an
unthinking rejection of the need to enquire at all.

Life is a process of breaking down and using other matter, and if need
be, other life.  Therefore, life is aggression, and successful life is
successful aggression.  Life is the scum of matter, and people are the
scum of life.  There is nothing but matter, forces, space and time,
which together make power.  Nothing matters, except what matters to
you.  Might makes right, and power makes freedom.  You are free to do
whatever is in your power, and if you want to survive and thrive you
had better do whatever is in your interests.  If your interests
conflict with those of others, let the others pit their power against
yours, everyone for theirselves.  If your interests coincide with
those of others, let them work together with you, and against the
rest.  We are what we eat, and we eat everything.  All that you really
value, and the goodness and truth and beauty of life, have their roots
in this apparently barren soil.

This is the true knowledge.

We had founded our idealism on the most nihilistic implications of
science, our socialism on crass self-interest, our peace on our
capacity for mutual destruction, and our liberty on determinism.  We
had replaced morality with convention, bravery with safety, frugality
with plenty, philosophy with science, stoicism with anaesthetics and
piety with immortality.  The universal acid of the true knowledge had
burned away a world of words, and exposed a universe of things.

The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they
are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is
commonly understood.  Indeed the world is ruled by little
else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt
from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some
defunct economist.  Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the
air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a
few years back.

Anyway, dissociation is a great coping skill. It can keep you going
and functional basically forever.  The problems hit when it starts to
break down, which is essentially as soon as you start to question your
own detachment.  Getting in touch with your emotions and experiences
is overrated, if you ask me.

A pirate would be even more useless to us, beyond any value there
might be in the hull.  Some find the Galactic Synarche
suffocating.. And I have a healthy sympathy for the whole
avoiding-suffocation thing.  But there’s asserting a reasonable
individuality in the face of social norms, and then there’s piracy and
murder as an economic model.

"Isn't all of human knowledge since the 1990s preserved in a
holographic solid somewhere?"  Preferably, somewhere in the Core, so
it wouldn't take so long to get to.

"A lot of people think so," he said.  "There used to be an axiom that
the Internet was forever."

I had to look up _Internet_ as he was talking.  A primitive form of
senso, without neural interface, accessible through small handheld
devices.

"And it's not forever?"

Graphics and charts and illustrations populated the screens around me,
a bewildering array.

"Nothing is forever," he said, as cheerfully as only a functionally
immortal artificial intelligence could.  "If retrieving archaic data
were easy, if there were no informational decay, my specialty would
not exist.  There would be no archinformists, no research librarians."

"Wait," I said.  "How can _information_ decay?"

"They used to call it _bit rot_.  Servers get taken down, data falls
through the cracks and doesn't get backed up.  Physical substrates are
destroyed or damaged, or degrade over time -- especially the
primitive ones.  A holographic diamond is very durable but can't be
changed once it's written to, and magnetic media only lasted a decan
or so under ideal conditions.

"And even if the data is preserved somewhere, that somewhere might not
be networked.  If it's networked, it might not be indexed.  Even if
it's indexed, it might be half the galaxy away and take two or three
ans for the file request to get there, be fulfilled, turn around, and
come back.  And then you might find out that you needed different
files entirely."  He huffed with great satisfaction.  "Infohistory is
a mess."

Sheer cussedness doesn't actually make luck break in your favor, and I

enough for luck to break.  And it seems to me that occasionally you
can't get results until you lose your temper with an object.

This was not, sorry to say, one of those times.  My exo did not fix
itself simply because I got extremely cross with it.  Maybe the
clinical efficiency of my rage was hampered by my current inability to
carry out percussive maintenance on the fucking thing.

I guessed I was going to have to outsmart it, then.

It's just pain.  Pain alone cannot stop you from doing things.  What
stops you from doing things is injury, disability … and being tired.
Because pain can make you tired, if it goes on for a long time.
Because that pain is not a warning that you are being hurt.  It's just
pain.  All it can do is make things harder than they need to be.

My family… my family was a very "every person for themselves" kind of
operation.  Not out of cruelty, but because nobody had a lot of
emotional resources to spare for anyone else, I suppose.  Especially
after my parents died.  I have never been very good at being there for
other people, as a result.

I am someone who mostly wants to pass unnoticed when she has been hurt
or has been harmed.  The vulnerability of being noticed -- even to be
comforted -- make me wary and self-conscious.  Maybe Tsosie is right,
and I do float through, a little above and to the left of the real
world.

So when it's someone else's turn to need comfort, it always feels like
I'm intruding.  Or, if someone is trying to help me, it feels like I
am being intruded upon.
