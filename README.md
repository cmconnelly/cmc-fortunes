## Fortunes for the fortune program.

Quotes that amused or otherwise interested me, mostly from books and TV shows.

Fortunes in `claire` are a mix; fortunes in `may-1968` are various slogans from the [May, 1968, almost revolution in Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1968_events_in_France).

Sources are generally noted for each fortune, but obviously I can't claim copyright on any of it myself; so any copyrighted materials belong to their owners.

Enjoy!
